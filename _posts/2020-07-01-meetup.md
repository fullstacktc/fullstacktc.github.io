WASM, Workers, and Rust (Oh My!) 
Web Assembly, or WASM, was originally designed for use in browsers, as a lightweight intermediate language that offers significant benefits over Javascript. Since its inclusion in Firefox and Chrome, it has found uses that far exceed its original scope : 
- Database Execution Engines
- Server Side Application Frameworks
- Desktop GUI Frameworks
Because of its efficiency and language neutrality,  WASM has the power to be the most transformative technology so far this century.
Rick will provide a high-level survey of WASM via Rust, and its application in CloudFlare Workers
